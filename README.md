* A QR code (short for "quick response" code) is a type of barcode that contains a matrix of dots. 
It can be scanned using a QR scanner or a smartphone with built-in camera. 
Once scanned, software on the device converts the dots within the code into numbers or a string of characters. 

To see the result, scanned the image using the scanner on mobile:
